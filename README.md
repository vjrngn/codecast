### Codecast


#### Motivation
LMS (or Learning Management Software) specifically for tech content isn't that easy to find. Most LMS offerings are too bloated with a whole bunch of features that aren't useful for tech content. After *A LOT* of searching online I was unable to find one that had, in my mind, the most essential set of tools to host and monitize technical content.

The motivation behind this project is to allow technical content creators (ie, coders) to do the following :

[ ] Course content creation
  [ ] Video courses
  [ ] One-off video walkthroughs
[ ] Control course publication
[ ] Monetize courseware via subscriptions
[ ] Track content consumption metrics
